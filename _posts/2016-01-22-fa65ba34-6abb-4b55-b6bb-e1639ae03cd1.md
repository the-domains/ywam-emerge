OUR VALUES

##### **Family**

##### _We value family by creating a tribal atmosphere with intentionally having a multi-generational workplace_

##### **Friends**

###### _We value unifying, God-honoring, authentic, collaborative relationships by making the friendship more important than the task at hand._

##### **Fun**

###### _We value quality of life both within and outside ministry activities by taking time together to laugh, play and never take ourselves more seriously than God does._

##### **Fruitfulness**

###### _We value quality, excellent and tangible outcomes, both corporately and personally, through strategic and focused tasks to not just create a good looking result but a lasting impact._
