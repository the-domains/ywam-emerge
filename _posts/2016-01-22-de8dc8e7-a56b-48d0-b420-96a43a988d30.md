Aquaponics

Aquaponics is the blending of aquaculture (fish farming) and hydroponics (growing plants in water). It can be defined as "a farming technique to produce food through the symbiotic relationship between fish and plants." The fish waste provides rich fertilizer to feed the plants allowing them to grow without stress. The plants then in turn filter the water which is returned to the fish tank. Emerge Aquaponics is a group of people dedicated to building these systems around the globe to provide all natural, organic vegetables and fish for undernourished communities.
